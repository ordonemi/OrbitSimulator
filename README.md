# Overview 
This project is a **2D orbital mechanics simulator** that models satellites, space debris, and a user-controlled spaceship tasked with de-orbiting space junk. The simulation follows realistic physics, including elliptical orbits, velocity-based fragmentation, and space debris movement. 

### Satellites & Objects  
- 🛰️ **Sputnik** – The first satellite, placed in a retrograde elliptical orbit.  
- 📡 **GPS Satellites** – Six satellites orbiting in a high-altitude trajectory.  
- 🔭 **Hubble Space Telescope** – A scientific satellite in a geostationary orbit.  
- 🚀 **Crew Dragon** – A SpaceX spacecraft in low Earth orbit.  
- 📶 **Starlink** – A communications satellite with fast orbital movement.  
- 🛸 **Dream Chaser (User-Controlled)** – A reusable spaceplane controlled by the player.

### Gameplay Mechanics  
**🎮 Controls:**  
- ➡️ **Left/Right Arrow** – Rotate spacecraft.  
- ⬇️ **Down Arrow** – Accelerate in the direction of rotation.  
- 🎯 **Spacebar** – Fire projectiles to destroy debris and clear space junk.

### Acknowledgments  
This project was completed using a pair programming methodology, my partner Austin Jesperson was essential to completing this project. By putting our ideas together we were able to end up with this final product.
